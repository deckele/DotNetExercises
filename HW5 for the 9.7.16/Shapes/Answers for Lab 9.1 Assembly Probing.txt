Answers for Lab 9.1: Assembly Probing

1. After moving dll to "ShapeLib" directory the app still works. 
   This is because the default search for "ordinary" not strongly named assemblies:
   Starts in the application base directory, and then checks in sub directories with the same name
   of the needed file (checking *.dll and *.exe file extentions).

2. After renaming "ShapeLib" directory to "bin", the app doesn't work, because we didn't edit the
   app configuration file to probe a specific subdirectory. The app can't find the the dll because
   of what was explained in 1.

3. After configuring the custom search path <probing privatePath="Bin" /> the app works again.
